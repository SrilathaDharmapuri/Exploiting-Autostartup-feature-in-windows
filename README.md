# Exploiting-Autostartup-feature-in-windows
The startup folder is a feature available in Windows operating systems that enables a user to automatically run a specified set of programs when Windows starts. The startup folder was introduced in Windows 95. It contains a list of applications or programs that run automatically whenever the computer boots up. It is usually located in the programs folder that can be opened by clicking the start button. The location of the startup folder may vary slightly in different versions of Windows. Any program that needs to be run automatically on boot-up must be stored as a shortcut in this folder. The startup folder is a feature that is included in Windows to provide convenience for its users. It allows users to gain instant access to the programs they frequently use. The shortcuts stored in this folder open automatically every time the computer boots. Items in the startup folder can include any type of executable application such as a word processing application, mail client, Web browser or even a particular file or document that the user may want to open whenever they start their system. Individual files can be added to the startup folder in the same way as applications by creating a shortcut and placing it in the startup folder.
The batch file is a term which often falls on the ears of Windows users. Basically, it’s a way of doing things without actually doing them. You might be aware of the Windows command line interpreter known as CMD or Command Prompt. It takes various commands as input through the keyboard and processes them. Being a Windows user, most of us aren’t much comfortable with anything that doesn’t look good, and CMD is one of them. A batch file does the work of a mediator between you and the command prompt. It is a file – with .bat, .cmd,. btm file extensions – containing the CMD commands. When you run a batch file, the commands written in it are executed in the Command Prompt following a serial fashion. Otherwise, these would have to be entered manually line by line. A batch file saves your time, otherwise, would be invested in typing the same commands again and again.
